# 🛡️ Bullying Analysis Explainable RAG System

An AI-powered Explainable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application built using Python, Streamlit, LangChain, ChromaDB, and Groq LLMs. This project analyzes bullying-related student survey data and provides evidence-based answers through semantic search and explainable AI techniques.

# 📊 Dataset Information

The project uses bullying-related student survey data containing features such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Cyberbullying incidents
- Physical bullying
- Loneliness indicators
- School absence
- Physical fighting
- Social relationships

The dataset is converted into structured AI-readable documents for semantic retrieval and analysis.

# 💡 Example Queries

- What factors are associated with students feeling lonely?
- How many students reported cyberbullying?
- What patterns exist between bullying and school absence?
- Are physically attacked students more likely to feel lonely?
- What age groups report the most bullying incidents?

# 🧠 Explainable RAG Concept

Unlike traditional chatbots, this system provides:

- Evidence-backed answers
- Retrieved supporting records
- Transparent reasoning
- Dataset-specific responses only

The model is instructed not to hallucinate or use outside knowledge beyond the retrieved evidence.

# 📈 Key Functionalities

## 📌 Data Extraction
- Extracts CSV data from ZIP files
- Cleans missing values
- Converts rows into structured documents

## 📌 Vector Embedding
- Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings
- Stores embeddings in ChromaDB

## 📌 Smart Retrieval
- Uses MMR retrieval for diverse and relevant evidence
- Metadata-enhanced search system

## 📌 LLM Reasoning
- Uses Groq-hosted Llama 3.3 model
- Generates concise analytical responses

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

- Data visualization dashboard
- Statistical trend analysis
- Multi-dataset support
- Conversational memory
- PDF report export
- Cloud deployment
- Advanced filtering options
